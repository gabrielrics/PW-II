    WWE's biggest annual event returns to Hollywood for WrestleMania 39.
    A marquee match between undisputed WWE universal champion Roman Reigns and Royal Rumble winner Cody Rhodes,
    will headline the events from SoFi Stadium over two days in Inglewood, California on Saturday, April 1 and Sunday,
    April 2.
    This year's main event would have been described as a fantasy dream match just two years earlier.
    Reigns has established himself as a superstar on par with years of previous expectations with a record-setting,
    dual championship campaign. Rhodes upgraded to a main event talent and a crucial component in the formation of AEW,
    the biggest non-WWE North American promotion since WCW was purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001. Rhodes' WWE return at
    WrestleMania 38 received much fanfare.
    Rhodes won the Royal Rumble in January to secure his spot against Reigns in his return from a seven-month absence
    due to injury.
